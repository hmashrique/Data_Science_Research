**From Andrew**

Let me say back what I think seems to be the consensus:

- Open problem solving from 1-3 should be in teams and include a peer
review component towards the end (possibly from 2-3)

- Keeping the talks/seminars from 2-3 is a feature not a bug because it
breaks things up

- On days where we have talks/seminars, we'll just eat into the open
problem solving/peer review time and keep 3-4 for the group
discussion/reflection

- Dale has proposed "exploring, wrangling, modeling, and communicating"
and other data science process talks. We could look at replacing what we
have with these, or we could talk about adding these on another day
(e.g. Tuesday).

Based on all the above, I think I can schedule out the slots for
everyone. I'll send a link soon.
