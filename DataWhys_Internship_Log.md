One week gone in the internship program. Every instructor has taken a session with the interns. Our session was on 
**getting to know the environment of jupyter notebook and blockly**.

## Next weeks schedule:

Morning

- Dale every morning

Afternoon

- Mon: Scott
- Tues: Drew
- Weds: Vasile
- Thurs: me (AO)

## Current Workflow:
Dale uses the morning sessions to teach the theory to the interns. In the afternoon, someone takes session on real problem solving of those 
concepts.

>"Dale and I are collaborating where she sends me theory/didactic
>notebooks that I elaborate with code. We're having an ongoing discussion
>on how to do that/improve that (she just sent me some new ideas that I
>haven't gone through yet)".
